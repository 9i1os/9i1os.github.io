<h3 id="method-no-1"><strong>Method No.1</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Read out loud.</strong></p>
<p><strong>大声朗读</strong></p>
<p>Read the text passage book or a blog in a good speaking voice. Try to be loud but don't scream, just loud enough to hear yourself.</p>
<p>用大到自己可以听见的声音朗读文章。</p>

The second benefit is it helps you improve your pronunciation because you will begin to listen to yourself more intently. The more you read out loud, the more you will listen to yourself and you'll begin to see which words you're pronouncing correctly and which words you're not pronouncing correctly.The third benefit is reading out loud actually helps to improve your comprehension. It helps you to internalize the words you are reading.</p>
<p>这样做会有三个好处。首先，眼睛耳朵并用，会使你更专注于信息。其次，听见自己的声音，额可以帮助你提高发音。你会听到自己哪些单词发音准，哪些不准。最后，有助于提高你的阅读理解能力，因为你正在消化读到的每个单词。</p>

<p>当读到新单词时，大声重复5～10次，重复练习发音。</p>
<p>You will begin to recognize which part of the word is difficult to pronounce. What happens is when you first save the word, you're going to realize and notice that your tongue or your mouth has a hard time pronouncing certain parts of that word. The next time you say that you will actually focus on that part so that you can say it better. You will gain confidence in your ability to say the word, which will increase your fluency.</p>
